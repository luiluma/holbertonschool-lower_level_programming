<p>A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node is connected to two other nodes in the list. This allows the list to be traversed in both directions, making it a very versatile data structure.</p>

<h2>Why is the doubly linked list called two-way?</h2>

<p>A doubly linked list is a data structure consisting of a set of nodes, each of which contains two pointers. The first pointer points to the previous node in the list, and the second pointer points to the next node in the list. The term "bidirectional" refers to the fact that pointers allow you to traverse the list in either direction.</p>

<h2>What are the types of doubly linked lists?</h2>
<p>1. The forward-only doubly linked list: This type of list only allows forward traversal of the list. You cannot traverse backwards in this type of list.</p>

<p>2. The Bidirectional Doubly Linked List: This type of list allows you to traverse the list in both directions, forward and backward.</p>

<h3>There are some key terms that are used when talking about doubly linked lists:
<p>- Node: each element of the list is called a node. Each node contains data and references to the previous and next node in the list.</p>
Head: The first node in the list is called the head.
<p>- Queue: the last node in the list is called the queue.</p>
<p>- Next: The next reference in a node points to the next node in the list.</p>
<p>- Previous: The previous reference of a node points to the previous node in the list.</h3>
